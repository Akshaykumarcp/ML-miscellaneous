### 3 Reasons why a simple model is preferred over a complex model !!
- Prevents Overfitting: A high-dimensional dataset having too many features can sometimes lead to overfitting (model captures both real and random effects).
- Interpretability: An over-complex model having too many features can be hard to interpret especially when features are correlated with each other.
- Computational Efficiency: A model trained on a lower-dimensional dataset is computationally efficient (execution of algorithm requires less computational time).
