### Why ML models fails to deploy 
- Stakeholders Lack Visibility and Deployment Isn't Fully Planned For
  - two main factors:
    - endemic under-planning and
    - business stakeholders lacking concrete visibility.
  - technical performance metrics are disconnected from business metrics
    - Business metrics tell you the absolute business value the model is expected to deliver â€“ or, when evaluating after deployment, that it has proven to deliver.
    - data scientists rank business KPIs like ROI and revenue as the most important metrics, yet they list technical metrics like lift and AUC as the ones most commonly measured.
